Welcome to my homepage! I am a first-year master's student at the University of Southern California, majored in computer science. I'm currently working on machine learning research in the [WiDeS](https://wides.usc.edu/index.html) group. Previously, I obtained my B.Sc. in Mathematics from Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)), China.

At the intersection of computer science and mathematics, I am an enthusiast for advanced techniques in artificial intelligence. I completed a software development engineer internship at [BaixingAI](https://chato.cn/), where I developed a large language model-based chatbot orchestration system.

During my undergraduate period, I published a first-author [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10436965) at IEEE Globecom 2023, focusing on multi-agent reinforcement learning. Additionally, I received the Excellent Freshman Scholarship, the Merit Student Scholarship twice, and the Excellent Graduation Thesis Award.
